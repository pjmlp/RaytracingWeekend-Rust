# Intro

This solution contains the Rust version of the [first weekend](https://raytracing.github.io/books/RayTracingInOneWeekend.html) of the Raytracing in one weekend series.

# Building

As any Rust project, just use `cargo build`.

# Executing

As I tried to place each main chapter into its executable, you can easily run each of them via `cargo run --bin chapterXYZ`.
